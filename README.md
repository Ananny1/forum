# forum
A forum project refers to a web-based application designed to facilitate online discussions or message boards, where users can create topics, post messages, and interact with others in a structured way. It’s typically used for communities to exchange ideas, ask questions, share knowledge, or have social interactions.

Key Components of a Forum Project:
User Authentication & Profiles:

Users can create accounts, log in, and maintain their profiles.
Profiles may include usernames, avatars, bios, and personal details.
User roles (e.g., admins, moderators, members) may have different levels of permissions.
Categories & Topics:

Categories are high-level divisions to group related topics (e.g., "Tech", "Gaming", "Support").
Topics are individual threads within a category where users can post discussions or questions.
Topics can have titles, tags, and timestamps.
Posts & Replies:

Users can create posts within a topic, which are displayed in a sequential order.
Posts can include text, images, links, and attachments.
Other users can reply to these posts, creating a thread of responses.
Posts and replies can be edited or deleted based on the user’s permissions.
